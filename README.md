# AI-Powered Document Analyzer

Welcome to my first hackathon project!  This project was built as part of a team during a hackathon. Iâ€™m currently a 2nd semester student, and this is my first experience working on a real-world problem using AI and web development.

##  Project Name
**AI-Powered Document Analyzer with Fraud Detection**

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic interface)
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **AI/ML:** PyPDF2, Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Other:** PDF parsing, SQLite, GitHub , Google API's , Tidio chatbot

## Features
-  User Registration & Login
-  Upload PDF Documents
-  Automatic Summarization of Text
-  Fraud/Red-Flag Clause Detection
-  Named Entity Recognition (NER)
-  User Profile Management

##  Inspiration
Some documents can be lengthy and hard to understand. Many people miss red flags hidden in the fine print. Our tool helps users by summarizing documents and pointing out suspicious or risky clauses automatically.
