# AI-Powered Legal Document Analyzer

Welcome to my first hackathon project!  This project was built as part of a team during a hackathon. Iâ€™m currently a 2nd semester student, and this is my first experience working on a real-world problem using AI and web development.

##  Project Name
**AI-Powered Legal Document Analyzer with Fraud Detection**

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic interface)
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **AI/ML:** Hugging Face Transformers (for summarization), Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Other:** PDF parsing, SQLite, GitHub

## Features
-  User Registration & Login
-  Upload Legal PDF Documents
-  Automatic Summarization of Legal Text
-  Fraud/Red-Flag Clause Detection
-  Named Entity Recognition (NER)
-  User Profile Management

##  Inspiration
Legal documents can be lengthy and hard to understand. Many people miss red flags hidden in the fine print. Our tool helps users by summarizing documents and pointing out suspicious or risky clauses automatically.
